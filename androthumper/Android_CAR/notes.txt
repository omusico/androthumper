TODO:
Make some kind of GPS Supplier class. Combines results from both phone and GPS module.
When asked for a lock, see if the module has a lock. If it doesnt, then enable the phone GPS.
Recieve listeners. Whenever whichever GPS is updated, pass those results on to whoever is listening. Allows multiple sources to go to multiple destinations though one class
the suppliers should implement common interface, and should only provide their updates to a GPSProvider when they get them. It is up to the provider to foward those results on to whoever is listening.

enable both module and device. On device, enable both location and status.
when either provide their data, convert the data to GpsData is needed. Store each providers last result, and the last good result.
Compare to find out which gpsprovider to use
if the data from the module has a lock, disable the device location and gps updates, and use it as good.
if it does not, use the devie gps data
pass data from module to listeners, and send raw data to server. Server rebuilds data from byte using same class from shared package, then displays.
