# Wild Thumper 6WD Chassis #

This project started out using an old donated RC car. While technically it worked, it went forwards and backwards, and it steered with a servo. However, it was small, not particularly powerful, and was awkward to steer.

Thus, the project was moved over to this.

There are some 'blueprints' on how to make something similar online, but it involves buying loads of Tamiya universal plates, then heating/bending/cutting them. Then the motors need to be bought, and put in 6 T-Pipe sections that just happen to fit. All of the 'just happening to fit' things, and nothing being certain, put me off. And the suspension relied on peg springs. More DIY than I fancied.

While this being expensive, its all metal, comes with all the motors, and has a sturdy suspension design. Win. Unfortunately though, the pitch of the mounting holes are 10mm, and do not line up very well with meccano, which I have loads of.
